\section*{Out of Control}

\begin{exploration}\label{exp:OJ}
  A machine at a juice factory is set to fill juice bottles with 300 ml of juice.  If the the process is operating normally, the mean amount of juice per bottle is historically known to be normally distributed with $\mu=300$ ml, and standard deviation of $\sigma=2$ ml. To check how well the process is running the factory routinely samples their output to avoid under-filling or over-filling the bottles.  Six samples of size $n=4$ are shown below.

\begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
\node[inner sep=0pt, anchor=base] (p1) at (0,0)
  {\includegraphics[height=60mm]{bottlesOJ.jpg}};
           \end{tikzpicture}
      \end{center}

Variation in the output is a normal part of any manufacturing process.  The first four samples are depicted to represent amounts close to 300 ml and a reasonable amount of variation.  Samples 5 and 6 are sketched to illustrate a process gone wrong.  If you compare samples 5 and 6 carefully, you will see that each points to a different kind of problem with the process.

Samples are collected to gauge the current quality of the process.  What does sample 5 indicate about the process?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{The process is no longer consistent.  Standard deviation is too high.}
\choice[correct]{The mean is much less than 300 ml.}
\choice{The mean is much greater than 300 ml.}
\end{multipleChoice}

What does sample 6 indicate about the process?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{The process is no longer consistent.  Standard deviation is too high.}
\choice{The mean is much less than 300 ml.}
\choice{The mean is much greater than 300 ml.}
\end{multipleChoice}
 
\end{exploration}

Variability is a natural part of any manufacturing process.  

\emph{Chance-cause variation} 

\emph{Assignable cause variation}

\emph{in-control process} 

\emph{out-of-control process} 

Samples 5 and 6 suggest that the process is out of control, statistical analysis will help us determine whether or not this is the case. 

\section*{Something significant...}
Let's take a look at the data corresponding to the graphic in Exploration \ref{exp:OJ}.  In the table below, individual volumes are listed for each sample along with numerical summaries.  You are familiar with sample mean ($\bar{x}$) and sample standard deviation ($s$).  You may or may not have seen the  \emph{range}, denoted by $R$.  The range, just like standard deviation, is a measure of spread of data.  It is given by the difference between the largest and the smallest values in the sample.  
$$R=\text{largest data point}-\text{smallest data point}$$

Both range and standard deviation can be used to estimate $\sigma$, but because the range takes into account only the two extreme values in the sample, it fails to capture the nuances of the spread, like standard deviation does.  For small samples ($n\leq 6$), either $R$ or $s$ can be used to estimate $\sigma$ with approximately the same efficiency.  As a result, when dealing with small samples, range is typically preferred over standard deviation due to ease of computations.

Compute $R$ for samples 3 and 6 and enter your answers in the cells provided.

Observe that sample mean for sample 5 is considerably lower than the other sample means, and also lower than the presumed population mean ($\mu=300$).  Observe also that the volumes in sample 6 are more spread out than the volumes in the other samples.  Is this part of the natural variation inherent in any manufacturing process, or is this an indication that the process is no longer in control?  The following questions will guide you to the answer.

\begin{question}\label{quest:popBellCurve}
Recall that this population is normally distributed with $\mu=300$ ml, and $\sigma=2$ ml.

\begin{question}\label{quest:samplingDist}
    Now we turn our attention to the distribution of sample means.  Given that the population is normally distributed with $\mu=300$ ml, and $\sigma=2$ ml, find the mean and standard deviation for the distribution of sample means (sampling distribution) for samples of size 4 ($n=4$).

    $$\mu_{\bar{X}}=\answer{300},\quad \sigma_{\bar{X}}=\answer{1}$$

\begin{hint}
    Use the Central Limit Theorem.

Select the most appropriate graph to represent the sampling distribution for $n=4$.

Now that we know what the sampling distribution should look like, let's take a look at where each sample falls within this distribution.

\begin{onlineOnly}
\begin{center}
\geogebra{uy3fusxy}{950}{650}
\end{center}
\end{onlineOnly}

IF the process is under control, then there is ZERO chance of us getting a sample such as sample 5.  Because such a sample did occur, we conclude that the process must be out of control, and must be paused.




\section*{Turning the normal distribution on its side}

Make up a chart for OJ example and show the first 6 samples

\section*{Control Charts}

x-bar and R charts.  Set up an R chart for the OJ example and compare and contrast what these charts show with regard to Samples 5 and 6.

\section*{Rules}
Write out Whatever rules we decide to use.  

This is where I think my example from the next section would fit to prepare students for the case study.

\subsection*{CASE STUDY: Thermoform production}

In theraform production, sheets of plastic are heated and molded into a desired shape.  In the Desmos sheet below, we can see the diameters of 80 different theraform spheres produced in Taiwan.  Notice that the last 20 were too big - something about the production had gone wrong.  Were there warning signs that a problem was coming before it happened?

\desmos{lwyjp4jqzh}{800}{600}

The following YouTube video gives some ideas of how we can use the Desmos sheet.

\youtube{NIg050X6q10}

Also included in the Desmos sheet are $\Bar{X}$-control charts for samples of size $n=3$ and $n=5$.  Maybe we can say something about applying Western Electric rules here.
