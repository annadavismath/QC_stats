\subsection*{CASE STUDY: Thermoform production}

In theraform production, sheets of plastic are heated and molded into a desired shape.  In the Desmos sheet below, we can see the diameters of 80 different theraform spheres produced in Taiwan.  Notice that the last 20 were too big - something about the production had gone wrong.  Were there warning signs that a problem was coming before it happened?

\desmos{z5dyz1p193}{800}{600}

The following YouTube video gives some ideas of how we can use the Desmos sheet.

Also included in the Desmos sheet are $\Bar{X}$-control charts for samples of size $n=3$ and $n=5$.  Maybe we can say something about applying Western Electric rules here.
