\section*{An Application of X-bar Charts to Manufacturing}
\end{onlineOnly}

In \emph{thermoform production}, plastic sheets are fed into machines which can turn them into molded plastic objects which are used in everyday life.  As an example, consider the molded plastic container holding the ``surprise" inside of the chocolate candy in the picture below.

\begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
\node[inner sep=0pt, anchor=base] (p1) at (0,0)
  {\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Kinder_Surprise.jpg}};
           \end{tikzpicture}
      \end{center}

In the following Desmos graph we can view 16 samples of 5 diameters measured during thermoform production in Taiwan.  From prior production runs it was known that the mean diameter was $\mu = 34.75$ mm, and the standard deviation was $\sigma = 0.17$ mm.  Let's assume that the samples are taken every hour.  For the ``surprise" to fit inside the plastic shell, and for the plastic shell to fit inside the chocolate candy, specification limits are set to $34.75\pm 0.55$ mm.  Any thermoform with a diameter greater than 35.3 mm or less than 34.2 mm is unusable.
 
\desmos{snvmxxizpj}{800}{600}

We can see that after the first 12 hours of production, most of the diameters that were sampled were too big, and so many thermoforms had to be scrapped.  The point of Statistical Process Control is to detect signs of a process being out of control early, so that corrections can be made and waste can be reduced.  

Observe that in the first 12 hours most diameters were within the spec limits.  This may seem like a reassuring sign,  but is it possible that even the early samples pointed to this thermoform production process being out of control?  In this section we will see how control charts could have been used to detect an out of control process early, and make adjustments before scrap is produced.  

\subsection*{When is it time to investigate?}

There will always be some variation in any process.  %At this point you have studied enough statistics to know that a very important idea is to determine when variation is \emph{significant} (i.e. worthy of further investigation).
One of the fundamental principles of statistical process control is that if a process is acting in a non-random way, the process can be improved.  Control charts are used to detect non-random behavior. In the previous section we discussed several general trends seen in control charts that indicate an out-of-control process.  We now formalize our previous observations with a set of rules.  The
 \href{https://www.qimacros.com/control-chart/nelson-rules/}{Nelson rules} for control charts is a common set of rules used in manufacturing to determine when a process may be out-of-control.  %We consider any of the following eight scenarios to be significant. 

 Recall, from the previous section, that control limits are typically set at three standard deviations away from the mean, where standard deviation, $\sigma_{\bar{X}}$ is given by the Central Limit Theorem to be 
 $$\sigma_{\bar{X}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$
 where $\sigma$ is population standard deviation and $n$ is the sample size.

See if you can apply the Nelson rules in the following problem.

\begin{problem}\label{prob:controlChartWithSlider}
Suppose that a manufacturing process is known to have a normal distribution with a mean $\mu=3.5$, and standard deviation $\sigma=2$.  A random sample of size $n=4$ is collected every hour to monitor the manufacturing process.  The distribution of sample means (sampling distribution) will be normal and $$\mu_{\bar{X}}=\answer{3.5},\quad \sigma_{\bar{X}}=\answer{1}$$

\subsection*{CASE STUDY: Thermoform production}

We return now to the application that we began this section with, and apply control charts to the thermoform production example.
Let's begin by determining the control limits for this example.  Recall that population mean and standard deviation were determined to be $\mu=34.75$ mm, and $\sigma=0.17$ mm.  

\begin{question}\label{quest:contLimTh}
For samples of size 5, we have 
$$\mu_{\bar{X}}=\answer{34.75}\mbox{ mm}$$
$$\sigma_{\bar{X}}=\answer{0.076}\mbox{ mm. (Round to three decimal places)}$$
Therefore,
$$LCL=\answer[tolerance=0.015]{34.51}$$
$$UCL=\answer[tolerance=0.015]{34.98}$$
\end{question}

Below we see an X-bar control chart constructed by computing the mean diameter of each sample of size $n=5$ we obtained earlier.  Individual measurements from each sample are shown in different color, sample means are shown in black. Let's see how the Nelson rules may have helped us to reduce waste in this example.

\textbf{HOLD EVERYTHING!!!}  The very first sample mean of 34.51 mm is more than three standard deviations ($\sigma_{\bar{X}}$) from the population mean, so it is below the LCL.  %We observe $34.75 - 3(0.076)=34.522>34.51$.  
Following Nelson Rule 1, we halt production and inspect, correcting anything that may seem to be wrong.  Then we resume production.

\textbf{WAIT A MINUTE!!!}  Our ninth sample mean is more than three standard deviations above the center line $\mu_{\bar{X}}=34.75$ mm.  We should stop and inspect the process.

\textbf{THIS PROCESS SEEMS OUT OF CONTROL!!!}  Our tenth sample mean is also more than three standard deviations above the center line.  We should stop and inspect the process, and take corrective action.

The point here is that by following the Nelson rules, we would investigate during the first hour of production and again after 9 or 10 hours.  Hopefully this would provide us ample opportunity to inspect and make modifications to the process before continuing, so that the diameters don't continue to grow to the point where they are unusable.
