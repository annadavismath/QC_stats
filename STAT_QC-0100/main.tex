\subsection*{Background}
Units of measurement are used to represent physical quantities like length, area, volume, mass, temperature, current, voltage, intensity, etc.  There are different measurement units used to represent the magnitude of the physical quantities. The International System of Units (SI Units) are the most widely used across the world. Measurement units compare how large or small a physical quantity is as compared to the basic standard quantity.  

$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} 
 \hline \text{Entity}&\text{Base Unit Name}&\text{Abbreviation}\\ \hline \text{Mass}&\text{kilogram}&\text{kg}\\  \text{Length}&\text{meter}&\text{m}\\
 \text{Time} &\text{second}&\text{s}\\
  \hline 
 \end{array}$$

\subsection*{Units}
When collecting and recording data, be sure to always include the correct units.  Also, the units must make sense to the magnitude of the data.  For example, if you were to measure the width of the room in which you are seated, the most logical SI units would be meters and the most logical measuring device would be a meter stick or tape measure.  
Why not record the width of the room in millimeters?  
Recording measurements in units that are logical helps with visualization of the actual size.  
Also, know when the unit is linear, squared, or cubed.   Check these images (not to scale):

\begin{question}\label{q:lengthAreaVolume}
    For each example, select an appropriate type of measurement.

    John lives in an $1,800$ sq. ft. house: \wordChoice{\choice{Length}, \choice[correct]{Area},\choice{Volume}}

    Sarah purchases $5$ gallons of paint: \wordChoice{\choice{Length}, \choice{Area},\choice[correct]{Volume}}
\end{question}

\begin{warning}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Units are as important to a measured value as the number. Always include units when recording a measurement. 
\item Make sure the units make sense. For example, don’t give the length of a typical pencil in meters -- instead give the dimension in centimeters or millimeters.
\end{itemize}
\end{warning}

 \subsection*{Units Conversion}

 \begin{example}\label{ex:unitConversion}
     Convert $575$cm to meters. 
     \begin{explanation}
     To do this, multiply $575$cm by a “strategic one”.  
$$575\text{cm}\times \frac{1\text{m}}{100\text{cm}}=\frac{575\cancel{\text{cm}}}{100}\frac{\text{m}}{\cancel{\text{cm}}}=\answer{5.75}\text{m}$$
     \end{explanation}
 \end{example}

 \subsection*{Measurement Process}
 Technicians measure stuff. Therefore, it is important to report a measurement in a meaningful and reliable format.
To do this, the technician must:
\begin{itemize}
\item Select the correct instrument and be knowledgeable of how it works and how to care for it.
\item Calibrate the instrument (transfer standards are traceable to \href{https://www.nist.gov/}{NIST} or other sources).
\item Report  measurement accurately, to a meaningful level of precision, and with proper units.
\end{itemize}

When measuring the thickness of a metal layer resulting from a chemical vapor deposition (CVD), a technician would use a scanning electron microscope \href{https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/05/leveling-sem-measurements-chip-manufacturing}{(SEM)}.  A SEM is a high precision, delicate instrument that requires training on how to use, care for, and calibrate the device. Many other measuring instruments are used in manufacturing including micrometers, calipers, hardness and surface testers, gauges, and more. 

The accuracy of a measuring instrument is the ability to yield the true or correct value and the precision is the ability to repeat values with small variation. For measuring instruments to be accurate and precise, they must be used correctly, handled and cared for properly, and calibrated. 

Calibration of measuring instruments is crucial to the measurement process. The calibration requirements vary by instrument and applications. Sometimes calibration might be as simple as checking or zeroing the instrument while some instruments used is critical measurement processes may require periodic calibration using standards or transfer standards from the National Institute for Science and Technology (NIST).
    
The degree of precision in reporting a measurement is limited by the least precise measuring instrument used in the process. 
\begin{question}\label{q:lengthOfRoom}
When measuring the width of the room you are in, suppose you used the balsa wood meter stick given to you at the local bank for opening a new account.  When you got near the wall, you pull out the engineer’s scale calibrated to millimeters and report the width of the room to the nearest millimeter.  Is that level of precision valid?  Discuss why or why not?   So how strong is a chain?  A chain is as strong as the weakest link just like a measurement can be no more precise than the least precise measuring instruments used in the process. 
\end{question}

\begin{question}\label{q:equalLength}
When recording a measurement, we write the numeric value to the level of decimal points used in the measurement and include units. Are the following measurements equal?  Explain your answer.   
$$20\text{cm}\quad 20.0\text{cm}\quad 20.00\text{cm}\quad 20.000\text{cm} $$

\begin{multipleChoice} 
\choice{Yes, $20=20.0=20.00=20.000$.} 
\choice{No, (insert silly reason here)} 
\choice[correct]{No, (insert a good reason here)}
\end{multipleChoice} 
\end{question}

\subsection*{Visualizing Manufacturing Data}

When measuring a large quantity of parts on the shop floor, it is common to simply create a list of data.  This list is then taken to a quality control room or office, where the data are entered into a spreadsheet for analysis. The spreadsheet is a tool that helps the data analyst to gather information about the process. From just the list, it would be difficult to estimate the average of the data collected. However, once we draw a picture of the data in the form of a histogram, we can use the histogram to gather information about the manufacturing process. 

We will start with the shape of the histogram.  This is a crude, subjective assessment of the histogram but can be a useful indicator.  If the histogram is normally distributed, then the process is experiencing only \emph{common} or \emph{natural causes of variation}. This type of variation is inherent in the process and not easy to reduce.  

If the histogram is not normally distributed, then the process is likely experiencing \emph{assignable causes of variation}.  Assignable causes of variation are unwanted issues that surface periodically and can normally be eliminated on the shop floor by machine operators.  Examples of assignable causes include operator fatigue, change in the quality of raw materials, equipment wear, drastic change in the manufacturing environment such as a drastic change in temperature or humidity.

\begin{exploration}\label{exp:histogram1}
Consider a sample of 100 silicon wafers whose thickness of a metal layer resulting from a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in a semiconductor plant. The data represent the layer thickness on semiconductor wafers measured in angstroms (one ten billionth of a meter).

We can see by the histogram output that the data has the triangular shape and symmetry associated with the bell shape. We can say that this sample data is normally distributed.

\subsection*{Specification Limits}
Manufactured parts typically have to fit with many other parts, so their measurements matter. Due to natural variation inherent in all manufacturing processes we cannot require a part to have a specific exact measurement.  Instead, we require that the measurement falls within a certain acceptable range based on practical restrictions on how big or small a part can be and still fit with the other parts.  Such restrictions are called \emph{specification limits} or \emph{specs}.  The diagram below shows the specification limits for the length of a screw.  The \emph{lower specification limit} (LSL) is the shortest length a screw can be to hold two planks of wood together; the \emph{upper specification limit} (USL) is the longest length a screw can be without sticking out on the other side and potentially causing injury.

\begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
\node[inner sep=0pt, anchor=base] (p1) at (0,0)
  {\includegraphics[height=40mm]{screw1.jpg}};
           \end{tikzpicture}
      \end{center}

If a part's measurement falls outside of the specification limits, the part is considered to be \emph{defective} or \emph{scrap}.  For example, we may order a batch of $50$ mm screws with specifications of $50$mm $\pm 6$mm.   Given these specs, a $52$mm screw is okay, but a $43$mm screw is scrap.

\subsection*{Evaluating Process Quality}
We will start by visualizing the output of two different machines engaged in manufacturing screws from our earlier discussion.  Recall that we set the specs for screw length to be $50$mm $\pm 6$mm.  

Use the check boxes in the GeoGebra interactive below to view the data from Machines 1 and 2.  The output from each machine is approximately normally distributed and appears to fall within the specs.  

\begin{onlineOnly}
\begin{center} 
\geogebra{gtfzbdzs}{900}{600} 
\end{center}
\end{onlineOnly}

\begin{question}\label{quest:compareMachines}
    What is true about the lengths of screws made by Machine 1 and Machine 2?  Check ALL that apply.
    \begin{selectAll}
        \choice[correct]{The means for the two machines are approximately the same.}
        \choice{The standard deviations for the two machines are approximately the same.}
        \choice{The standard deviation is smaller for Machine 1}
        \choice[correct]{The standard deviation is greater for Machine 1}
        \choice{Only the means can be estimated from the graph.  We cannot compare standard deviations.}
    \end{selectAll}
\end{question}

The data in the GeoGebra interactive above shows that the output from both machines falls within the specification limits.  In other words, neither machine has produced scrap.  However, the number of data points used to construct these histograms is relatively small -- only 100 points were used for each machine.  Given that Machine 1 came very close to spilling outside the spec limits, it is very likely that manufacturing $1,000,000$ screws using Machine 1 would result in a number of defective screws.  Machine 2 appears to be less likely to produce scrap than Machine 1.  In the next example, we use the Empirical Rule to estimate the amount of scrap produced by Machine 1.    

\begin{example}\label{ex:defParts1}
    Suppose that the output of Machine 1 can be described using a normal distribution with mean $\mu=50$ and standard deviation $\sigma=2$.  If a batch of $1,000,000$ is ordered, how many defective screws do you expect?
    \begin{explanation}
        Observe that $50-3\sigma=44$ and $50+3\sigma=56$.  By the Empirical Rule, $99.73\%$ of the data lies between $44$ and $56$.  The end-points of this interval just happen to coincide with the spec limits.  In other words, the spec limits are located at $\pm 3\sigma$ away from the mean.  Therefore, $99.73\%=0.9973$ of output falls within the spec limits.  This may seem like a good thing, but if we fill an order of $1,000,000$ parts using Machine 1, then the number of defective screws will be approximately
        $$(1-0.9973)\times 1,000,000=0.0027\times 1,000,000=2,700$$       
    \end{explanation}
\end{example}

\begin{question}\label{quest:defParts1}
    Suppose that a new employee was assigned to Machine 1 and the machine's performance changed as a result.   The output of the machine can now be described using normal distribution with mean $\mu=50$ and standard deviation $\sigma=3$.  Your goal is to approximate the number of defective screws per one million.

    Recall that $LSL=44$ mm and $USL=56$ mm. Where are the spec limits in relation to the center of this distribution?

    \begin{multipleChoice}
        \choice{The spec limits are at $\pm \sigma$.}
        \choice[correct]{The spec limits are at $\pm 2\sigma$.}
        \choice{The spec limits are at $\pm 3\sigma$.}
    \end{multipleChoice}

Rounded to the nearest integer, what percent of data is located within the spec limits?

Percent of data within spec limits: $\answer{95}\%$

How many defective parts per million do we expect to see?  

Defective parts per million: $\answer{50000}$ ppm

Compare your answer to this question with Example \ref{ex:defParts1}.  Which of the following is true about a normally distributed process?

\begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{If the process mean is unchanged, then greater standard deviation leads to more scrap.}
    \choice{If the process mean is unchanged, then smaller standard deviation leads to more scrap.}
    \choice{If the process mean is unchanged, then the amount of scrap remains the same regardless of what happens to standard deviation.}
\end{multipleChoice}
    
\end{question}

Process mean and standard deviation both affect the amount of scrap produced by the process.  The Desmos interactive below allows you to visualize the number of defective parts that result from normally distributed processes with various means and standard deviations.  Use the slider to change the mean and standard deviation of the distribution and observe how the number of defective parts changes.

\begin{onlineOnly}
\begin{center} 
\desmos{f95viwzyer}{800}{600} 
\end{center}
\end{onlineOnly}

\begin{question}\label{ex:defParts3}
    Suppose that the output of Machine 2 can be described using normal distribution with mean $\mu=50$ and standard deviation $\sigma=1$.  If a batch of $1,000,000$ is ordered, how many defective screws do you expect?  Use the Desmos interactive above to find out.  Round your answer to three decimal places.

    Number of defective parts per million: $\answer{0.002}$ ppm.

    If the mean of Machine 2 shifts to $51.3$, with $\sigma =1$, how many defective parts per million do you expect?  Round your answer to one decimal place.

    Number of defective parts per million: $\answer{1.3}$ ppm.
\end{question}

\begin{question}\label{prob:specs1}
At this point you should have an idea of how the histogram needs to be positioned in relation to the spec limits in order to minimize scrap.  Let's summarize these characteristics.  To reduce the number of defective parts the most desirable conditions are (select TWO).

    \begin{selectAll}
        \choice[correct]{data are centered between the spec limits}
        \choice{data are shifted to the low side}
        \choice{data are shifted to the high side}
        \choice[correct]{the data spread is narrower than the specification limits}
        \choice{the data are spread from the lower spec limit to the upper, but does not spill over.}
        \choice{the data spread is wider than the specification limits.}
    \end{selectAll}
\end{question}

\subsection*{Quality Standards}
Different industries use different quality standards to minimize defects.  For example, the \emph{six-sigma} approach, introduced by Motorola in the late 1980s, requires that the mean is centered between the specification limits, and that specification limits are located at least six standard deviations away from the mean.  Use the slider to increase/decrease the standard deviation of the process depicted below and see when the process meets the six-sigma quality standard and when it does not.

\begin{onlineOnly}
\begin{center} 
\geogebra{uu7sxwfs}{900}{600} 
\end{center}
\end{onlineOnly}

In the above interactive, specification limits stay fixed while the standard deviation changes.  This highlights the fact that there is no inherent relationship between the specs and standard deviation.  Specification limits are dictated by real-life requirements and often cannot be altered.  Standard deviation is a characteristic of a particular process and its implementation.  Steps can be taken to reduce the standard deviation in order to adhere to the six-sigma standard.

\subsection*{Accuracy and Precision}

Let's generalize what we have learned about the spread of data compared to the specification limits.

If the histogram is well-centered within the specification limits, then the process is \emph{accurate}. That is, the process is making product that is close to the nominal or midpoint of the specification range.

If the spread of the data is as wide as the specification limits, then the data is not very \emph{precise}, and the process is likely to be making scrap.

Use the sliders in the GeoGebra interactive below to visualize accuracy and precision.

\end{onlineOnly}

\subsection*{Summary}
Histograms provide three pieces of information about the data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shape of data.  Measurements from a production process are typically normally distributed.  
    \item Accuracy.  The histogram must be centered between the specification limits.  
    \item Precision.  The histogram should roughly occupy the middle half of the space between the spec limits. 
\end{itemize}
If the histogram is not bell-shaped, well-centered within the spec limits or is too wide, the process needs to be paused and evaluated.
