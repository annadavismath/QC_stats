%\section*{About this Project}
The purpose of this project is to offer supplementary resources for use in introductory statistics courses.  Our overarching goal is to provide students an intuitive, conceptual introduction to some 
aspects of statistical process control.  We do this in the context of manufacturing, with a particular emphasis on the skills required of technicians in the semiconductor industry.

This project is overseen by Ohio Dominican University in partnership with OTN NEO Intel Regional Partners led by Lorain County Community College and funded by Intel.
